/**
 * @dev Contract that manages an account that can receive funds and automaticaly split
 * them according to each user's share. The contract also supports basic share transfer manipulation
 * allowing users to move share's from one account to another.
 * Whenever funds are received the split is automatically triggered and funds are moved inside 
 * each user's private ballance from where he can retreive funds on demand.
 * 
 * Contract flow:
 * When the contract is created the creator will receive all the shares. 
 * Share management can be done off-chain and shares can be passed on by simply moving
 * them from the starting account to the any number of new accounts(new shareholders).
 * Only a valid account(shareholder) can add another shareholder to the user base by passing on shares.
 *
 * Total shares in the contract is 10_000. And the minimum an account can hold is 1 which translates to 0.01%
 * If at any point an account sends away all of his shares that account will be removed from the shareholders list.
 * Existing users can check their balance and also retrieve funds.
